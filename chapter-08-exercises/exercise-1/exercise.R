# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists

# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast

my_breakfast <- c("chocolate muffin", "yogurt", "coffee")

# Create a vector `my_lunch` of everything you ate (or will eat) for lunch

my_lunch <- c("chicken teriyaki")

# Create a list `meals` that has contains your breakfast and lunch

meals <- list(breakfast = my_breakfast, lunch = my_lunch)

# Add a "dinner" element to your `meals` list that has what you plan to eat 
# for dinner

meals$dinner <- c("coffee")
print(meals)

# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'

dinner <- meals$dinner
print(dinner)

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason beyond practice)

meals[[4]] <- meals[["lunch"]]
print(meals)

# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early_meals`

early_meals <- meals[c("breakfast", "lunch")]
print(early_meals)

### Challenge ###

# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item

length(meals)

# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector


# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
